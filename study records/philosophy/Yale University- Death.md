## Intro

The crucial point is to take a good, cold, hard look at death, and to face it and think about it in a way that most of us don't do.

In the class we will talk about:

- Do we have immaterial souls, something that might survive the death of our body?
- What kind of an event is death?
- If death is the end, is death bad?
- What should my atitude be wowards my mortality[^3]?  

The professor's view:

- There is no soul.
- Immortality[^4] would not be a good thing.
- Sucide, under certain circumstances, might be rationally and morally justified.
